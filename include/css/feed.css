/*
Make RSS and Atom feeds at least semi-legible to folk who accidentally
load them in a browser...

Compatibility:
* Mozilla is fine.
* Safari 1.2: the RSS <link> text isn't shown
* Opera 7.5 uses the style sheet instead of its native RSS mode.
* IE/Mac 5.2: none of the :before content works; doesn't get the charset right and displays garbage for non-ASCII.
* IE/Win 6.0: No background color, borders, font size, font weight, or :before content.
